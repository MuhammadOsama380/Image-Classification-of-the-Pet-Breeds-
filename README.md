# Image-Classification-of-the-Pet-Breeds-
In this project I have implemented image classification using deep learning models to classify different classes of pets. The data set that I have used is Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset. I have used four different models for the task a custom CNN, ResNet18, ResNet34, and ResNet50.
