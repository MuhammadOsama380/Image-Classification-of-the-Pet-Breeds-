#  Pet Breed Classification using CNN & ResNet Models

This project implements and compares deep learning models for classifying pet breeds using the [Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/). It demonstrates the effectiveness of **custom CNNs** vs. **transfer learning** with **ResNet18**, **ResNet34**, and **ResNet50**.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to classify images of cats and dogs into one of **37 different breeds** using deep learning models. The project explores the performance trade-offs between:
- A custom CNN designed from scratch
- Pretrained ResNet architectures with transfer learning

##  Dataset

- **Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset**  
- 37 Classes (Cats and Dogs)  
- ~100 images per class  
- Train / Val / Test split: 70% / 15% / 15%



## Setup & Run

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tqdm
